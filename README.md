Assignment 17 – Apply JavaScript and CSS Classes to an Existing HTML Document for Interactivity Coursework 8 
Steps:
1.  Create a GitHub Repository named “m8-hw8-lastname-firstname” replacing “lastname” and “firstname” with your own
2.  Clone the repository into the folder on your computer where you store your course Coursework assignments
3.  Using logical Git commits, complete the following in the master branch:
   a.  Add the provided starter files to the repository with the commit message “Add starter files”
     i.The navigation menu has been styled for you. Note that it is not responsive,    and that is ok. You will be creating the functionality for a desktop menu only
   b.  Using the provided HTML, CSS, and JS files, manipulate the webpage so that the corresponding sub-menus appear with a CSS transition when a user hovers over the menu labels
     i.The sub menu should be hidden by default. You will need to add some CSS to make this happen
     ii.When a user hovers over the main menu labels, the corresponding sub-menu should appear using a CSS transition
     iii.When a user moves the mouse out of the main menu label, the corresponding sub-menu should disappear using a CSS transition
     iv.Only one sub menu should show at a time. Make sure that the right sub menu appears when you hover over each label
   c. Push all commits to your remote GitHub repository
4.  Note: There are many different, yet correct, ways to solve this coding challenge. The way I code it may be different than the way you code it, and that is ok. Do your best to solve the coding challenge with no errors in code or the console.5.  Make a mental note about how JavaScript can allow you to manipulate the DOM in response to events in order to create highly interactive experiences
